# TracksOfFire

Compose, edit, and play MIDI files with a tablature based ui.


### This is not the greatest midi editor in the world. This is just a tribute...

TracksOfFire is totally inspired by Easy Beat, the awesome musical authoring program designed by Günther Blaschek and distributed by Macility/Ergonis Software. Easy Beat was discontinued some time ago and TracksOfFire is an attempt to recreate some of its greatness!

## To use:
Download or clone this repo. Run the `start.sh` script or open a terminal and execute
`java -jar build/TracksOfFire.jar`.
TracksOfFire is written in Java so you'll need that.

To rebuild and run with your awesome and needed improvements run the `startDev.sh` script. Rebuilding with this script is done with ant so you'll want that.

## Contribute:
**I would love and appreciate any advice, contributions, feedback, issues etc that anyone might have!**
