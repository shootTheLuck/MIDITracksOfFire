# TracksOfFire

Compose, edit, and play MIDI files with a tablature based ui. This is not the greatest midi editor in the world. This is just a tribute. TracksOfFire is totally inspired by Easy Beat! Easy Beat was an awesome musical authoring program designed and produced by GÃ¼nther Blaschek and distributed by Macility/Ergonis Software.

## To use:
Download or clone this repo. Run the `start.sh` script or open a terminal and or execute `java -jar build/TracksOfFire.jar`. TracksOfFire is written in Java so you'll need that.

To rebuild and run with your awesome and needed improvements run the `startDev.sh` script. Rebuilding with this script is done with ant so you'll want that.

## Contribute:
I would **love** and appreciate any advice, contributions, feedback, issues etc that anyone might have! I'm a total amateur here and am trying to improve. Please hit the dang issues button!

GOALS/TODO's:
- architecture improvement. A lot of this is truly spaghetti code. Plus lasagna code.
- the drum GUI
- documentation
- tests!
- undo/redo
- adding measures via edit menu (started)
- warn on close before save
