#MIDITracksOfFire

This is not the greatest midi editor in the world, no. This is just a tribute.

Easy Beat was a terrific musical authoring program for the Macintosh by Macility/Ergonis Software. Just a matter of opinion, but I think it was the greatest musical authoring program in the world! Among its other great features was a unique method for handling guitar and bass tablature: something like a cross between "piano roll" and standard tab notation. Simply drag a note down one of the string lines in the tablature display, give it a fret number and you were all set. It was the greatest! Sadly, Easy Beat was discontinued sometime in the early OSX days, and I haven't been able to find another music program that handled tablature in a similar way again so...here is my amateur rendition.

To use: download or clone this repo. Run the start.sh script or open a terminal and execute "java -jar build/MIDITracksOfFire.jar". It's in Java so you'll need that.
To rebuild with your awesome mods run "ant jar". You'll need ant to do this.

I would **love** any contributions, feedback, issues etc that anyone might have! Hit the dang issues button! There's all kinds of messed-up stuff to work on!

TODO's:
    undo/redo!
    adding measures via edit menu
    themes (skins) out of source and into plain text files
    warn on close before save!
