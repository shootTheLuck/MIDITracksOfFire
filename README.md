# TracksOfFire

Compose, edit, and play MIDI files with a tablature based ui. This is not the greatest midi editor in the world. This is just a tribute. TracksOfFire is totally inspired by the musical authoring program designed and produced by GÃ¼nther Blaschek, (c) and distributed by Macility/Ergonis Software.


## To use:
Download or clone this repo. Run the start.sh script or open a terminal and execute `java -jar build/TracksOfFire.jar`. It's in Java so you'll need that.
To rebuild with your awesome and needed improvements run `ant jar`. You'll need ant to do this.

## Contribute:
I would **love** any contributions, feedback, issues etc that anyone might have! Hit the dang issues button! I'm a total amateur here. There's all kinds of messed-up stuff to work on!

TODO's:
- learn to program better!
- undo/redo
- adding measures via edit menu (started)
- warn on close before save!
