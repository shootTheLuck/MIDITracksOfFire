# TracksOfFire

Compose, edit, and play MIDI files with a tablature based ui.

## To use:
Download or clone this repo. Run the start.sh script or open a terminal and execute `java -jar build/TracksOfFire.jar`. It's in Java so you'll need that.
To rebuild with your awesome mods run `ant jar`. You'll need ant to do this.

## Contribute:
I would **love** any contributions, feedback, issues etc that anyone might have! Hit the dang issues button! There's all kinds of messed-up stuff here to work on!

TODO's:
- undo/redo!
- adding measures via edit menu
- themes (skins) out of source and into plain text files
- warn on close before save!

## Credits:
- This is not the greatest midi editor in the world, no. This is just a tribute. TracksOfFire is totally inspired by the musical authoring program Easy Beat by Macility/Ergonis Software.
- RepoMan.mid is a midi rendition of Repo Man by Iggy Pop from the "Repo-Man" soundtrack. Midified by me and included here for demonstration purposes only
- Artwork and soundfonts are the work of others and licensed separately by their respective authors
- Tribute is a song by Tenacious D
